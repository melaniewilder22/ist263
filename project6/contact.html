    <h1>My Experience as a Syracuse Cheerleader</h1>
    <main id="main">
    <p class="second">As a Syracuse cheerleader, my experience of the football games is quite unique. My first year as a cheerleader, however, I couldn't even cheer because of COVID. There were a few times my freshman year that we were teased with the fact that we might be able to attend a game, but then COVID cases would rise again, and we couldn't go. So, my whole freshman year no one on my team was able to go to a football or basketball game. Instead, throughout the year, we practiced and prepared in case we did go to a game. Also my freshman year, we participated in an ACC cheer competition over zoom. We placed in 3rd overall.</p>
    <p class="second">My sophomore year was the first time I was able to cheer at a game. The feeling of being down on that field with thousands of people in the stands is an indescribable experience. The game started and it was absolutely electric. While last year's season wasn't the greatest, it was such a rush to be able to finally be on that field. As a cheerleader, we do a performance alongside the band and the dance team called the pregame. Essentially, it is a routine we do that includes our dance and tumbling to the fight song, a dance to the pride of the orange song, the national anthem, and the alma mater. After that, we do the run on with the football team where we run in front of the football team, wave to the crowd, then go to our spots for the first quarter. Being on the field while the game is going on is an absolutely amazing experience. You truly feel the energy of the field -- good or bad. It can be difficult when the energy is bad to get the crowd cheering again. However, with a few cheers, a few stunts, and a few third downs, we are typically able to get the crowd excited and engaged again.</p>
    <p class="second">This year, my junior year, is the best year of my cheerleading experience at SU so far. The first game against Louisville was the best game I have ever experienced. The massive crowd was cheering and engaged in everything that was happening. They cheered along side us when we chanted - which rarely happened the previous year. The energy in that game was unlike any other. The next home game against Purdue was similar. At first, we thought we were going to lose, but Syracuse pulled out and started getting touchdown after touchdown. The cheerleaders and I were losing our minds on the sidelines. After every touchdown we jumped and cheered along with everyone else in the stadium. Every game up until the Clemson game felt electric. You could feel the energy in the stadium. But, after the Clemson game, the energy in the stadium decreased significantly.</p>
