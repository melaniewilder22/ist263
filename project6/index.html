        <div><p class="para1">Syracuse University Football has very much had its ups and downs throughout history. For as long as Syracuse fans can remember, SU somehow always loses the game within the last half of the game. Whether we are winning by 20 or its neck and neck, Syracuse seemed to lose. However, this year - at least up until the Clemson game -- SU had an incredible start to the season. Winning their first six games this season, they seem to have turned things around for themselves. Not only that, but the fans were returning to the stadium as well. Filling the stadium to almost 80% capacity, and even selling out certain games. In the past few years, especially with COVID still being a prevalent issue and the team not doing so well, fans were not coming as much. But now that we are starting to come out of the pandemic and the Orange gained traction, people are flocking to the stands.</p></div>

        <div><p class="para2">However, after Syracuse's loss to Clemson, the season seemed to start going downhill. The team seemed to lose their spirit halfway through the Clemson game and decided that they had already lost. After that game, Syracuse seemed to lose all of their momentum and hope from the season after that loss and continued to lose every game following Clemson. Even at the senior game against Florida State, the team just seemed to be hopeless from the start.</p></div>

        <div><p class="para3">With the last game of the season, Syracuse was able to gain some of their traction back by winning the game against Boston College. Syracuse will also play in the <a href="https://seatgeek.com/pinstripe-bowl-minnesota-vs-syracuse-tickets/ncaa-football/2022-12-29-2-pm/5718571">Pinstripe bowl</a> on December 29th, 2022 in the Yankee Stadium.</p></div>
