    <p>I am an Information Technology and Policy Studies major at Syracuse University. I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina which is far from SU, but my family always had the Syracuse games playing. So, as soon as I was accepted in Syracuse University, I knew I wanted to be part of the gameday team, so I tried out for the cheer team.</p>
