    <p>I am an Information Technology and Policy Studies major. I have always had an interest in technology since I was young, I wanted to understand what made computers work and what WiFi was and why I always needed it. For policy, the fastest way to change the world for the better is through policy - hence why I am majoring in it. My greatest accomplishment was being able to work as a C.I.T. Director at my summer camp this year. Outside of those things, I love to watch superhero movies and hangout with my friends.</p>
